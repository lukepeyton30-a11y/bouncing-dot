Description of a bouncing ball game:
   - The player is trying to keep ball off the ground with the line.
   - The game starts with a ball and a short, horizontal line, near the bottom of the screen.
   - The ball starts at the top of the screen, and moves downward. Then, the ball bounces off of anything that it contacts, but the ground.
   - When the ball hits the ground, it shows game over in a big font, and restart.
   - The player can control the line by the A/D or the arrow keys.
